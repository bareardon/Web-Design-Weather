## Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)


## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

In this project, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations in a past project. 

This website contains the below key components:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. 
  * A sidebar 
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A description of the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page for comparison
  * A Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table is a bootstrap table component. 
    * Convert the data to HTML.
* A navigation menu
